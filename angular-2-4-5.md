# Angular 2, 4, and 5
With a little effort, ngx-extended-pdf-viewer works with Angular 5 and Ionic 3. Thanks to GitHub user @tanzl88 for finding out how. They've also provided a running demo projekt: https://github.com/tanzl88/ionic-3-extended-pdf-viewer.

For technical reasons, the binary files of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer are not compatible with Angular 5 or below. So do not run npm install. Instead, copy these files into your local project:

- <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/blob/main/projects/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/src/assets/pdf.js">pdf.js</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/blob/main/projects/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/src/assets/pdf.worker.js">pdf.worker.js</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/blob/main/projects/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/src/assets/viewer.js">viewer.js</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/tree/main/projects/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/src/lib">the folder ngx-extended-pdf-viewer</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/tree/main/projects/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer/src/assets/locale">the locale folder</a>

After that, follow these steps:

1.  Load the file `pdf.js` in index.html
2.  Copy the source code ngx-extended-pdf-viewer into your own project (as a new component)
3.  Convert the file `ngx-extended-pdf-viewer.css` into the Ionic format (remove styleUrls)
